The bot successfully retrieved the tracking information (shipped Dec 13, 2025) but stalled by looping back to request the ticket description after presenting the status. The interaction concluded with the bot creating a priority support ticket and promising contact within 24 hours, along with a working tracking link. The resolution is pending external team follow-up."
