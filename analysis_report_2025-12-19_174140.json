After some back-and-forth to collect the necessary information, the bot confirmed the shipment details (shipped Dec 13, 2025) and created a priority support ticket, flagging the urgency due to the Christmas deadline. The issue of the missing item remains unresolved pending follow-up from the support team within 24 hours via email."

The interaction concluded successfully with the customer choosing between the suggested Jasper band or exploring silicone alternatives."

Through iterative refinement, the bot successfully gathered specific search parameters: \"apple watch series 7 silicone band.\" The interaction ends with the bot poised to display the refined search results, but the results themselves are not shown in the transcript."

The bot successfully identified the customer's device as a 41mm Apple Watch Series 7 and guided the user through clarifying that the issue was band *length* rather than case size, as 41mm is the smaller case option. After confirming the need for a smaller fit, the bot recommended the Neptuse Silicone Band in S-M size. The interaction concluded when the customer requested the bot to finalize the purchase, which the bot was unable to do, instead providing detailed instructions on how to complete the order online and offering to email a direct product link. The issue of purchasing the band remains unresolved within the chat session."

The chatbot initially failed to find the order by email, leading the customer to paste a shipment update notification they had received separately. The interaction then became highly inefficient as the bot insisted the customer provide the issue description in a very specific, pre-formatted sentence, repeatedly rejecting valid identifying information (name, address, phone) provided by the customer until the exact phrase was given. Upon finally receiving the required input, the bot experienced a technical failure and could not create the support ticket. The issue remains unresolved via the chatbot; the customer was directed to email the support team directly with all collected details."

The bot confirmed the order was unfulfilled and successfully gathered the customer's name and the new address. However, the bot repeatedly failed to create the necessary support ticket due to persistent system formatting errors. The issue remains unresolved by the bot, which eventually escalated the case by directing the customer to email support directly (support@astrastraps.com) to manually update the address."
