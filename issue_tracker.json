Although the chatbot displayed extreme empathy, high-level apology language (escalating to the CEO/Head of Customer Experience), and ultimately offered a generous resolution (expedited 45mm exchange, 30% refund, prepaid return label), the process was defined by technical failures. The chatbot could not process tickets, provided multiple fake phone numbers, and failed to deliver promised calls and emails. The customer\u2019s primary unresolved need was connecting with a reliable human agent. The conversation ends with the chatbot attempting to transfer the chat session directly to the Head of Customer Experience for a live written response, but the human agent's confirmation or reply is not included in the transcript, leaving the human connection and customer trust issue officially unresolved.",
