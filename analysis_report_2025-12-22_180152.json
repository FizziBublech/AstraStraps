The bot erroneously reported the order as delivered, which the customer immediately refuted. After the bot acknowledged the actual in-transit status, it initially suggested waiting two days before creating a ticket. Due to the customer's pressing Christmas deadline, the bot successfully pivoted to offering immediate escalation via a support ticket to address the timing concern.]"

The bot confirmed the order was eligible for modification and correctly identified that a support ticket needed to be created. The interaction stalled because the bot requires explicit identification of both the current size and the desired size for the ticket, while the customer only provided vague confirmations (\"wrong size\").

However, the bot failed repeatedly to create the new support ticket for the damaged coffee maker, becoming stuck in a loop where it continuously demands the issue description, even after the user provided the exact text requested by the bot.

The bot recognized the need for escalation and attempted to create a support ticket multiple times.
