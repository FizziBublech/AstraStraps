The human immediately escalates the interaction by threatening to report the company to their bank as a scam if the order status is not clarified.\n2.  **Unanswered Questions/Unresolved Issues:** The core issue (a discrepancy between the carrier status \"Delivered\" and the customer's claim \"was not delivered to me\") remains unresolved. The bot accurately identified the data but the actual package location issue requires a manual investigation.\n3.  **Technical Errors:** No technical errors were detected. The bot successfully parsed the order number, retrieved the correct delivery and tracking information, and offered the appropriate and accurate escalation path (opening a support ticket) to address the delivery discrepancy."
