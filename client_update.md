# **AstraBot Development Update**

## **‚úÖ What's Working & Ready for Testing**

### **Core Support Functionality:**
- **Support Ticket Creation:** Fully working - creates tickets in Reamaze "Astra Straps" channel
- **Previous Conversations:** Bot can find existing tickets by customer email or order number
- **Ticket Status Checking:** Can check and update existing support tickets
- **Product Information:** Uses website content for sizing, compatibility, care instructions, etc.

### **Information Gathering:**
- Collects customer email, name, and issue summary before creating tickets
- Asks for specific issue details before making function calls (more natural conversation flow)
- Avoids duplicate tickets by checking previous conversations first

## **‚ùå Key Limitations Discovered**

### **1. Order Information Not Available**
- **Issue:** Reamaze doesn't contain order data - cannot provide order tracking, status updates, or modifications
- **Impact:** Bot cannot answer "Where is my order?" or provide ETAs/tracking numbers
- **Solution Needed:** CRM integration to access order information

### **2. Knowledge Base Empty**
- **Issue:** Reamaze knowledge base has 0 articles
- **Impact:** Bot uses website content only for self-service (limited compared to dedicated KB)
- **Current Workaround:** Uses `get-company-info` to pull information from website

## **üîÑ Current Workflow**

1. **Gather Details:** Bot asks for specific issue details first
2. **Self-Service:** Uses website information to help with sizing, compatibility, care instructions
3. **Previous Conversations:** Checks for existing tickets to avoid duplicates
4. **Create Tickets:** For unresolved or complex issues, collects proper customer information
