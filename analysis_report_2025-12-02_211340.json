Their issue (non-receipt of a package marked delivered) remains unresolved at the end of the transcript.\nSUMMARY: [The customer is inquiring about missing order #135482, which they suspect is a scam. The bot confirms the system shows the order was fulfilled and marked \"Delivered\" by the carrier (USPS) on Nov 15, 2025. The customer insists the package was not received and is still listed as \"being shipped.\" The bot correctly diagnoses this as a delivery status discrepancy and offers to open a support ticket for investigation, but the core issue of the missing package is still unresolved.]"

The bot handled the initial emotional escalation well, agreeing to open a priority support ticket to investigate the delivery issue. However, when attempting to create the ticket, the bot suffered a critical technical failure, entering a long loop of holding messages before finally admitting it was \"unable to create a support ticket at this time.\" The interaction ended with the highly frustrated customer being redirected to traditional support channels (email/phone), leaving the package status and support escalation unresolved.]"

When the customer agreed to view the sale items, a critical technical error occurred, preventing the chatbot from accessing the product catalog. The customer tried to proceed by specifying their watch model, but the bot remained functionally blocked, only able to offer the creation of a support ticket or general care instructions, leaving the customer\u2019s shopping intent completely unresolved.]"

The bot failed entirely to process this query, locking itself into an extensive loop of generic delay messages (\"Just a sec,\" \"be right back,\" etc.) before timing out. The customer's initial question remains completely unanswered, and the interaction was a total failure."
